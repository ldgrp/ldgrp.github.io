description: Geeking out about coffee and different ways to prepare coffee.
---

I am always looking for ways to improve my coffee.
The recipes below document how I prepare my coffee at home.

In general, I prefer to use an Aeropress for ease of use and consistency.
When I'm craving a milk-based coffee, I use a Moka Pot with a Bellman Stovetop Steamer.
