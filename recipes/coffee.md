1. add 17g ground coffee
2. pour 100g water in 10 seconds.
3. stir for 15 seconds.
4. bloom for 1 minute 40 seconds.
5. wet paper filter.
6. pour 150g water in 10 seconds.

## French Press

i use james hoffman's [technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8).

coffee: 33g \
grind: medium (17 clicks - Timemore C2) \
water: 500g @ 96°C \
ratio: 1:15 \
time: 9-12 minutes \

1. add 33g ground coffee.
2. pour 500g water.
3. wait for 4 minutes.
4. stir crust.
5. scoop foam and coffee.
6. wait for 5-8 minutes.
7. press until the plunger sits on the surface of the coffee.


## Aeropress Latte
   
technically, the aeropress does not make espresso. it can, however, make
a *strong*, tasty cup of coffee.

i don't have counter space for a dedicated milk frother and
stovetop steamers take too long. i think a french press
works just fine™.

coffee: 23g \
grind: fine (9 clicks - Timemore C2) \
water: 90g @ 93°C \
milk: 170g @ 65°C \
ratio: 1:4 \
time: 1 minute 30 seconds \

1. add 23g ground coffee
2. pour 90g water in 10 seconds.
3. stir for 10 seconds.
4. wait for 1 minute 10 seconds
5. while waiting, microwave $^{eek}$ 170g milk until it reaches 65°C (around 90 seconds)
6. press down for 10 seconds.
7. pour heated milk into the french press and plunge (violently)
   for 15 seconds, stopping every 5 seconds to swirl the milk.
8. pour frothed milk into coffee.
