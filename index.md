# About Me

Hi! I'm Leo, a third year student studying Computer Science at the [University of Queensland][uq].

I'm really interested in functional programming, backend development, and operations research. I have a casual
interest in mathematics.

A list of my hobbies (in no particular order) ---
coffee, [cooking][recipes], baking, [pizza][pizza] (homemade pizza at least once a week!), 
[music][music], movies and TV, musical theatre,
guitar, skateboarding (just picked it up. it's _never_ too late),
electronics, 3d printing, board/tabletop games and reading.


Feel free to contact me by [email][email].

You can find me on [GitHub][github] and [LinkedIn][linkedin].
