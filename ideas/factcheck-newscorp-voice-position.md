The Saturday Paper has an [article][tsp-newscorp-no] on how News Corp is framing
the 'No' case for the Voice to Parliament referendum. It claims that:
"News Corp, via its various newspapers, has become the unofficial mouthpiece
of the 'No' campaign."

An example is given of The Australian's edtiorial stance on the Voice, with
an observation that its tone had shifted from in favour to against.

Greg Craven claims that "It's probably the only media outlet that has actually
published pieces from completely different opinions."

My idea is to factcheck this claim by looking at the number of articles
published by News Corp in the last year and to apply semantic analysis to
the articles to see if they are in favour of the 'Yes' or 'No' case.
It would also be interesting to see if the tone of the articles has changed
over time.

We can scrape the articles from the News Corp websites, looking specifically at:

- The Australian
- The Daily Telegraph
- The Herald Sun
- The Courier Mail

and to compare them with articles from:

- The Sydney Morning Herald
- The Age
- The Guardian
- ABC News
- etc.
