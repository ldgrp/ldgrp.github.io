iOS Shortcuts allow users to create Personal Automations that run on [NFC triggers][nfc-trigger].
I want to scan an NFC tag stuck on the bottom of my [coffee canister][tobys-estate] that starts a 
timer on my phone for my preferred brew method (currently [Aeropress][aeropress]).

### Notes

- Blank NFC tags are really cheap and can be attached anywhere.
