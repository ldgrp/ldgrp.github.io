### Update

A demo is available at [https://room-ldgrp.vercel.app/](https://room-ldgrp.vercel.app/).

After a few hours of playing around with Blender, I have a basic model
of my room. I'm still not happy with the lighting and I'm not sure how
to get the model to look more realistic. I'm also need to spend some time
adding more detail to the meshes.

I want to create a 3D model of my room using [Blender][blender].
There's some interesting things I can do with this model:

- I can sync it with [Home Assistant][home-assistant] to show the current state of my room.
- I can figure out the current position of the sun and show how light
comes into my room at different times of the day. The skylight
over my desk and the west-facing window make for some interesting
lighting effects.
- I can show how my bedroom layouts change over time and show a
catalogue of different bedrooms I've had over the years.

I am unfamiliar with Blender so this will be a learning experience.
