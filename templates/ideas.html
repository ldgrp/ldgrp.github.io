<p>
A collection of half-baked ideas I want to build. 
There is no guarantee that I will ever build any of these, but I want to keep track of them somewhere.
Their usefulness may be questionable, but I think they are interesting enough to document.
None of them are particularly groundbreaking and may probably already exist in some form or fashion.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments.
